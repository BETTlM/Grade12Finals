# Grade12Finals
Grade 12 2023 24 final year computer science project 

This is my project I did for my grade 12 final year computer science internals.
I have used computer vision to determine the number of people present inside a room that updates in real time.

# Modules Needed
1. subprocesses
2. time
3. random
4. numpy
5. cv2
6. tkinter
7. threading
8. font from tkinter
9. canvas from tkinter


# Running the program
Make sure to install the required modules
Run the `running.py` , do not try to run other files on its own
If the UI doesnt pop up (which happens often), kill the processes and re-run the `running.py` in a new terminal.
